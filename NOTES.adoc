General notes/toolchain tips.

== Installing Verilator

The quick way is to install from the package manager:

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install verilator
----

However, currently (on Ubuntu 22.04) this provides Verilator 4. If you need verilator 5, follow these steps to install it (see https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html[here]):

[,bash]
----
sudo apt install git help2man perl python3 make autoconf g++ \
     flex bison ccache libgoogle-perftools-dev numactl perl-doc \
     libfl2 libfl-dev
----

Then clone the repository and build as follows:

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator
cd verilator

unset VERILATOR_ROOT
git checkout stable
autoconf

# Install in your home directory to manage
# the installation more easily.
mkdir $HOME/opt
./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
make -j `nproc`
make install
----

Finally, make sure `$HOME/opt/bin` is added to your path in `.bashrc`. Open a new terminal and run `verilator --version` to check the installation.
