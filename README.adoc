= Basic RISC-V
:toc:

This repository contains a simple RISC-V core, made for two purposes:

* To show what is required for a minimal compliant RISC-V core.
* To experiment with different architectural features and explore their effect on performance, area and power.

The specification for the design is xref:SPEC.adoc[].
